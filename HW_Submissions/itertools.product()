# Assignment
# calculate cartesian product of two variables A and B
# A and B are sorted lists
# no duplicate integers
# 0<A,B<30
# output space separated tuples of cartesian product
# input looks like:
#       1 2
#       3 4
# output looks like:
#       (1,3) (1,4) (2,3) (2,4)

# method
# start by gathering A and B
# these are given so let's just establish them

# import the cartesian product tool
from itertools import product as product

# establish given sets. Not sure if assignment wants user input for space separated tuple?
# A = [3, 19]
# B = [8, 17]
A = list(map(int, input("Enter set of numbers A separated by space(s)\n").split()))
B = list(map(int, input("Enter set of numbers B separated by space(s)\n").split()))

print(list(product(A, B)))
