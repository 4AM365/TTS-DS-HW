# Exercise 1

# In mathematics, the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0 can be solved with the formula x=−b±b2−4ac√2a.

# Write a function solve_quadratic, that returns both solutions of a generic quadratic as a pair (2-tuple) when the coefficients are given as parameters. It should work like this:

# print(solve_quadratic(1,-3,2))
# (2.0,1.0)
# print(solve_quadratic(1,2,1))
# (-1.0,-1.0)

# You may want to use the math.sqrt function from the math module in your solution. Test that your function works in the main function!

import math
print("enter a")
a = input()
print("enter b")
b = input()
print("input c")
c = input()
s1 = 0
s2 = 0
sol = (0, 0)
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)
s1 = -b-math.sqrt(d)/(2*a)
s2 = -b+math.sqrt(d)/(2*a)
sol = (s1, s2)
print(sol)

# Exercise 2

# Get a space-separated list of integers from the user, create a tuple of those integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(tuple).

# Documentation: hash():
# Exercise 3

# Take the following two lists. Create a third list by picking a odd-index elements from the first list and even-index elements from the second.

# listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
# listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]

# Exercise 4

# Take the following list. Slice it into three equal chunks and reverse each list.

# sampleList = [11, 45, 8, 23, 14, 12, 78, 45, 89]

# Exercise 5

# Iterate through a given list and check if a given element already exists in a dictionary as a key’s value. If not, delete it from the list.

# rollNumber = [47, 64, 69, 37, 76, 83, 95, 97]
# sampleDict ={'Zach':47, 'Emma':69, 'Kelly':76, 'Jason':97}
