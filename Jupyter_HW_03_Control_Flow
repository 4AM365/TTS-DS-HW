# Exercise 1

# Guess a number between 1 to 9 given by the user


# Exercise 2

# Check the validity of password input by the user.

# Validation:

#     At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z]
#     At least 1 number between [0-9]
#     At least 1 character from [$#@]
#     Minimum length 6 characters
#     Maximum length 16 characters

# Exercise 3

# Get input of the age of 3 people by user and determine oldest and youngest among them

# Exercise 4

# A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%.

# Take following input from user

#     Number of classes held
#     Number of classes attended.
#     And print
#     percentage of class attended

# Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not?

# Exercise 5

# Get an integer N from the user and perform the following actions:

#     if N is odd, print "weird"
#     if N is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print "Not Weird"
#     if N is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print "Weird"
#     if N is even and greater than 20, print "Not Weird"
