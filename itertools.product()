#Assignment
    #calculate cartesian product of two variables A and B
    #A and B are sorted lists
    #no duplicate integers
    0<A,B<30
    #output space separated tuples of cartesian product
#input looks like:
#       1 2
#       3 4
#output looks like:
#       (1,3) (1,4) (2,3) (2,4)

#method
    #start by gathering A and B
        #these are given so let's just establish them

from itertools import product

A = [3, 19]
B = [8, 17]

print list(itertools.product(A, B))
