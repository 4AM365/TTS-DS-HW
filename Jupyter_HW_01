# What is the output of the following Python code

x = 10
y = 50
if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100):
    print(x, y)

    # If the variables 10 and 50 satisfy the logical condition, then display the variables in the output
    # To satisfy the condition, 10^2 must be greater than 100 and 50 must be less than 100.
    # 10^2 is equal to but not greater than 100, so it does not satisfy the condition.
    # There is no output.

#  What is the output of the following addition (+) operator, and why does this code chunk execute this way?

    a = [10, 20]
    b = a
    b += [30, 40]
    print(a)
    print(b)

    # The output is [10, 20, 30, 40]; [10,20,30,40]
    # This happens because both a and b are affected by operations performed on b

# What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators is being used here? print(2%6)

    # The output is 2
    # % is the modulo, which finds the remainder of a division operation

# What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators are used here? print(2 * 3 ** 3 * 4)

    # The output is 216
    # The * performs a multiplication operation while ** is a number to the power of the following number
    # Per order of operations, 3**3 = 9, 2*27*4 = 216

# What is a text editor?
    # A text editor is a GUI where ASCII symbols can be manipulated and saved.

# What is python?

    # Python is a programming language which can be sent to the python interpreter and used to give instructions to
    # many layers of underlying software. It is high-level, and 'declarative' allowing the user to input the desired result rather than
    # focusing on how to program the underlying machine to do so.

# What is jupyter notebook, what type of python environment is it, and what alternatives are there to jupyter notebook?

    # A jupyter notebook is a browser-based interface for creating, editing, storing, and executing python files stored on a host computer.
    # Python environments are directories where particular libraries are loaded. In Jupyter, the Conda suite of libraries is accessible.
    # Jupyter can be supplanted by editors such as VSCode and PyCharm. Alternately, python can be executed via command line by navigating
    # to the python environment, initializing it, then executing a file or typing directly into the interpreter input.
