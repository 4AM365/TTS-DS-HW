# Complete the following exercise and submit the github link to your jupyter notebook file:


# You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

# Complete the Student class by writing the following:

# A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:

#     A string, firstName
#     A string, lastName
#     An integer, id An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores

# A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:

# A | 90-100
# B | 80-89
# C | 70-79
# D | 60-69
# F | <60

# Sample Input

# Heraldo Memelli 8135627
# 2
# 100 80

# Sample Output

#  Name: Memelli, Heraldo
#  ID: 8135627
#  Grade: O
